Refugee
-------

A simple way to migrate your data without being tied to an orm.


Design and Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The use case for this design is to have a wrapper around sql and scripts that
help version and control the migration process. This should do the following
* require next to 0 setup
* control all migrations in a transaction and assure that each applies cleanly
* prevent migrations from being applied multiple times
* attempt to merge long branches of migrations

Testing
